 <div> This project is a website based on many popular online social media platforms such as Instagram. We have built this project using Mongo DB database system, Node JS and Express JS for backend as well as React JS for front-end development.
  <br>Every user can create a personal profile and post pictures on this website. Users can also see posts from other users they follow. All these functionalities have been implemented using the No SQL database MONGO DB, using different schemas as well as operations.<br> Mongo DB does not use SQL for performing operations on data, instead it uses its own set of pre-defined functions to perform operations like create, replace, delete, etc. In this project we have thoroughly explored and implemented MONGO DB while learning about its functionalities and database management strategies.</div>
